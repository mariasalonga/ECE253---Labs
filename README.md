Lab 3 - This lab involves designing and simulating digital circuits in System Verilog, including a 7-to-1 multiplexer, a 4-bit ripple carry adder (RCA),
and a simple arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs various operations with parameterized input bit-widths. Students complete pre-lab design, coding,
simulations, and optional FPGA testing throughout the lab.
Lab 4 - This lab explores fundamental synchronous logic elements, including latches, flip-flops, and registers. It involves building a gated D-latch on
a breadboard, designing a sequential ALU with registers using D flip-flops, and creating a 4-bit rotating register with parallel load and arithmetic
shift functionality.
Lab 5 - This lab focuses on designing counters and controlling clock operations in digital systems. It involves creating a 4-bit synchronous counter
using T flip-flops and expanding it to an 8-bit counter. The second part introduces a counter that displays hexadecimal values at adjustable speeds
using a rate divider to slow down the clock.
